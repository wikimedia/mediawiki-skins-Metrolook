### Bugs
Bugs and issues should be reported on the MediaWiki Phabricator or GitHub.
It is strongly recommended that you use Phabricator to report bugs and submit
feedback, as more developers will see the report and are able to act on it.

Phabricator is located at:

https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/mediawiki-skins-metrolook/

If, for some reason, you are unable to unwilling to use Phabricator, you can
submit your bug on GitHub, but it is likely to receive less attention there
than on Phabricator.

The GitHub bug reporting URL is:

https://github.com/paladox/Metrolook/issues

It is recommended that you spend a while reading the documentation and
searching the archived discussions before posting a question - it is
possible that someone has experienced the same issue with this software
that you are experiencing currently.
